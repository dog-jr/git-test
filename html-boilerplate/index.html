    <!-- This is a collection of many thoughts -->

    <p> There's something so different about the way that your mind works when you're 
        doing it to prove something to others versus when you're working to prove 
        something to yourself</p>
    <p> I think that the current arc of my life consistenly tempts me with an interest
        in doing it for others, but I always come back to what I personally am most 
        interested in.</p>
    <p> It's honestly a little difficult.</p>
    <p> Because I've convinced myself that I do <strong>so much</strong> for others â€” 
        which might be true.. but I'm always realizing that most of it.. it just done
        for <em>me</em>.. for my own interests.</p>
